% Massive stars, those with more than ten times the mass of our Sun,
% live short and tumultuous lives ending in dramatic supernova
% explosions that leave behind neutron stars or black holes. These
% stars are typically not evolving alone: most have one (or more)
% companion stars orbiting around them at distances such that as the
% stars evolve, they will "touch each other," exchange mass, and
% sometimes even merge. These interactions can modify the appearance,
% evolution, and fate of both stars in the binary, with implications
% for the galaxy they reside in and the compact objects they produce.
% In most cases, when the first star reaches the end of its life and
% explodes as a supernova, it ejects the surviving "widowed" companion
% at speeds of several tens of km/s–these massive stars live fast in a
% very literal sense. Join us in this seminar as Dr. Mathieu Renzo
% guides teachers through a scientific exploration of the life and
% death of massive binary stars over the last 2000 years, reviewing
% the basics of stellar evolution, making connections to the visible
% night sky, and sharing observations across the electromagnetic
% spectrum and in gravitational waves. In the second half of the
% seminar, teachers will continue with small group discussions as they
% dive into the content and data presented. This seminar is best
% suited for physics and mathematics teachers, but all are welcome.

% Dr. Mathieu Renzo is a stellar physicist at the Center for
% Computational Astrophysics of the Simons Foundation Flatiron
% Institute. His research focuses on the double-sided relation between
% the evolution of massive stars in binary systems and their final
% explosions.

  %%% So how do we study this process of stellar explosions? This is
  %%% the perfect example of how theoretical astrophysics work: you
  %%% make a physical model, write down the equations, plug them into
  %%% a super-computer and obtain a numerical simulation. This however
  %%% requires many layers of abstraction: how we write the equations
  %%% and how we tell the computer to solve the equations matters a
  %%% lot for the kind of answer that you get.

  %%% Nature doesn't need to do all of this, it does not need to know
  %%% how stars explode to make them explode! Therefore, and this is
  %%% not true just to understand how stars explode, but in general
  %%% for any theoretical astrophysics problem, we need to compare to
  %%% observations to avoid fooling ourselves!

\note{  But let's start with something a bit more familiar. This is a
  constellation of the northern sky which probably most of you
  know. You can use it to find the direction of north by
  taking this side and prolonging fine times in it's direction to
  find the Polaris.

  This constellation was used in ancient Greece as an entry-test
  to become a student of astronomy. The question is how many
  stars are in this constellation?

  In reality there are more: Mizar and Alcor are a visual binary,
  that is two stars orbiting each other in a binary system, and it
  is such that if you have a very good sight, you can distinguish
  them by naked eye. The greeks used this to test the sight of
  perspective students.

  In reality things are even more complicated, infact Mizar itself
  is a quadruple system (but these stars you cannot distinguish
  with your naked eye). Alcor itself in 2009 has been claimed as a
  binary, so this system in the end is actually three pairs of
  binaries!
  Stars are typically born in binary or multiple systems.

  Broadly speaking, what I study is how this fact changes the
  evolution of stars, and how they die.

        defined as a runaway star. Typical threshold (no physical meaning) are
        30 or 40 $kms$.I use $30kms$. For O type stars about 10-30\% of stars
        are in the tail, and this is comparable to Be stars (and maybe slightly
        more than all early B-type stars), although these fractions are very
        uncertain because of the difficulty of measuring the 3 components of the
        velocity of a star and defining what is the tail of the distribution.\\

        Note that HYPERvelocity star, with velocities larger than the escape
        velocity from the Galaxy have also been found, but these require
        different ejection mechanisms I will not touch upon.

  \frametitle{How to measure stellar velocities}
  \note{  but how do we know that a significant fraction of massive stars
    are runaways? To measure their velocities is not always easy. We
    can have bow shocks if they move supersonically compared to the
    ambient ISM, which can be used to constrain the velocity. We can
    use the Doppler shift of spectral lines to measure their velocity
    along the line of sight, and IF their distance is known, we can in
    principle also use their proper motion, to measure the transverse
    velocity of the star. I care to mention this because the future
    Gaia data release will provide distances (through parallax) and
    proper motions of many more stars, potentially increasing the
    sample of runaways known in the galaxy.

  \note{What causes these natal kicks responsible for the binary
  disruption?
  From an observational point of view we know they exists because
  we see pulsars moving much faster than their parent O and early B
  type stars. From a theoretical perspective, we think that these
  kicks are due to asymmetries in the explosion dynamics, either in
  the neutrino flux that drives the explosion (although this is
  presently a bit disfavored) or because of the hydrodynamical
  instabilities in the explosion. For instance, here you see an
  entropy rendering of the core of an exploding 15Msun star, but
  for simplicity you can think of the color as the density. As you
  can see, this is not spherically symmetric: here you have a big
  red clump, which if it is denser, can gravitationally pull the
  proto-compact object (for up to a second) and as long as we have
  some ejecta in the other direction to conserve momentum, we can
  accelerate the proto compact object in the direction of the
  densest ejecta. }

  \note{  To conclude, I want to show you a widowed star that you can find
    in the skies of the Netherlands with your naked eyes. Some of
    you probably recognize this constellation, it's orion. It is
    visible in the winter, and you can recognize it from the "orion
    belt". This dongle here is full of massive stars. But here, you
    see Betelgeuse, a famous massive star because it is said to be
    about to explode (i.e. in the next ~1000 years). The interesting
    thing, is that this is also most likely a widowed star: it moves
    at 30km/s and also has the bow shock (like the wave in front of
    the boat!). So every night, you can see one of the stars that I
    wish we will use to understand BH formation and SN explosion
    without seeing either the BH or the SN.
