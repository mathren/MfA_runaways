* Explore /Gaia/ DR3 dataset -- no coding required

 The [[https://flathub.flatironinstitute.org/][Flatiron Institute Data Exploration and Comparison Hub]] (FlatHub)
 is an official host of the /Gaia/ data releases ([[(https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...616A...1G/abstract][DR2]] in 2018 and [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220800211G/abstract][DR3]] in
 2022). From there you can download the entire datasets (very large!),
 or more likely the subset of the data you need for a project. These
 data are the result of the processing of raw instrumental reading
 from the instruments on the /Gaia/ satellite by the /Gaia/ Data Processing and Analysis
 Consortium ([[https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac][DPAC]]).

 FlatHub also provides an interface to visualize the data and play
 with it in your browser without the need to use any coding. There is
 a limit on what you can achieve, but that should be plenty for today.

** Instructions

 We will download the data for one of the satellite Galaxies of the
 Milky Way, specifically the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Magellanic_Cloud][Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC, where the 30
 Doradus region (aka Tarantula Nebula) and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R136][R136 cluster]] reside.

 1. Go to https://flathub.flatironinstitute.org/
 2. Select the =Gaia DR3= catalog. This will bring you to the interface
    in the above screenshot.
 3. Notice the number at the bottom left: /Gaia/ DR3 contains more than
    1.8 billion stars! We will select only a subset of these stars,
    and we will use only some of the data available for each star.
 4. The tabs =Filter=, =Python=, =All Fields=, and =About= top right provide
    tools to make a sub-selection. Click on the =All Fields= tab.
 5. Scroll the lists of data available for each star and select some.
    You can select/unselect entire "sections" of data (e.g., =pos= for
    positional, =pm= for proper motion, etc.). There are 152 option for
    each star. You probably never want all of them, and *the more use
    the slower the interface*. What you want to plot determines what
    data you select. Select for example:
    - =pos ra=, =pos dec,= /right ascension/ and /declination/, the angles defining a position on the sky (e.g. where a star is),
    - =pm=, =pmra=, =pmdec=, the /proper motion/ and its components
    - =parallax=
    - =phot_g_mean_flux=, this is the brightness of the star. It is
      measured in /Gaia/'s G band.
    - you can deselect =source_id=, a unique number for each source in
      /Gaia/.
    Now these "columns" of the dataset are available for each star ("row").
 6. Now the =Filter= tab allows you to select filters based on the
    available data. *Hint*: if too many stars meet your filtering
    criteria interface slows down, you can always cancel the query and
    restart from where you were. Add filters, for example:
    - =phot_g phot_g_mean_mag= between the minimum and 16, this selects
      the brightest stars (the highest the parameter the faintest the
      star, astronomy is weird sometimes) and guarantees your dataset
      will not be too large to work with.
 7. On the top right, there is a control panel for the plot area
    to visualize the data you selected. Try plotting a =heatmap= with
    =pos ra= as x axis and =pos dec= as y axis using the drop down menus.
    This produces

    a plot on the plane of the sky of where the bright stars
    (because of our =Filter=) are in the /Gaia/ DR3 dataset.
 8. Add additional filters to select stars in a particular region of
     the sky and very far away (i.e. very small parallax, probably
     with large errors)
    - =pos ra= between 74 and 94 degrees
    - =pos dec= between -74 and -64 degrees
    - =parallax= smaller than 0.02 milliarcsec.
    The plot updates alone, and you should see where most bright stars
    are in the LMC (but likely still with spurious contaminants)!
 9. Try adding filters, e.g. on =pos ra= and =pos dec= to find structures
    (see [[./playground/README.org][this list]] for inspiration). Use =parallax= to filter in
    distance and, =pmra=, =pmdec=, and =rv= for the velocity. Use the errors
    to do quality cuts.
 10. To speedup your tests, Under =Random Sample= you can select at
    random a fraction of the stars matching your filters at the bottom
    (and to keep things reproducible you can specify a seed random
    number that always will pick the same random set of stars).
 11. *How to save the data*: at the bottom right there is a =FORMAT= and
    =DOWNLOAD= button. You can download the subset of data you are
    playing with as "comma separated value" =csv= file (see drop down
    menu for other options). This format can then be open and analyzed
    using spread sheets without any coding. You can also download the
    plots you make from the drop down menu in the top right of the
     plot area.
