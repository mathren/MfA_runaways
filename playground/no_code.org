* Explore /Gaia/ DR3 dataset -- no coding required

 The [[https://flathub.flatironinstitute.org/][Flatiron Institute Data Exploration and Comparison Hub]] (FlatHub)
 is an official host of the /Gaia/ data releases ([[(https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...616A...1G/abstract][DR2]] in 2018 and [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220800211G/abstract][DR3]] in
 2022). From there you can download the entire datasets (very large!),
 or more likely the subset of the data you need for a project. These
 data are the result of the processing of raw instrumental reading
 from the instruments on the /Gaia/ satellite by the /Gaia/ Data Processing and Analysis
 Consortium ([[https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac][DPAC]]).

 FlatHub also provides an interface to visualize the data and play
 with it in your browser without the need to use any coding. There is
 a limit on what you can achieve, but that should be plenty for today.

** Instructions

 1. Go to https://flathub.flatironinstitute.org/
 2. Select the =Gaia DR3= catalog. This will bring you to the interface
    in the above screenshot.
 3. Notice the number at the bottom left: /Gaia/ DR3 contains more than
    1.8 billion stars! We will select only a subset of these stars,
    and we will use only some of the data available for each star.
 4. The tabs =Filter=, =Python=, =All Fields=, and =About= top right provide
    tools to make a sub-selection. Click on the =All Fields= tab.
 5. Scroll the lists of data available for each star and select some.
    You can select/unselect entire "sections" of data (e.g., =pos= for
    positional, =pm= for proper motion, etc.). There are 152 option for
    each star. You probably never want all of them, and *the more use
    the slower the interface*. What you want to plot determines what
    data you select. Select for example:
    - =pos ra=, =pos dec,= /right ascension/ and /declination/, the angles
    defining a position on the sky (e.g. where a star is),
    - =pm= section, i.e. =pmra=, =pmdec=, =pmra_error, =pmdec_error= the /proper motion/
    components and relative errors
    - =parallax_error=, =parallax_over_error=
    Now these "columns" of the dataset are available for each star ("row").
 6. Now the =Filter= tab allows you to select filters based on the
    available data. *Hint*: if too many stars meet your filtering
    criteria interface slows down, you can always cancel the query and
    restart from where you were. Add filters to select a region, for
    example:
    - =pos ra= between =200= and =360= degrees
    - =pos dec= between =-89= and =89= degrees
 7. On the top right, there is a control panel for the plot area
    to visualize the data you selected. Try =histogram= of =pos ra=.
    TODO IMPROVE
 8. You can set other filters on =parallax=, =pmra=, =pmdec=.
 9. To speedup your tests, Under =Random Sample= you can select at
    random a fraction of the stars matching your filters at the bottom
    (and to keep things reproducible you can specify a seed random
    number that always will pick the same random set of stars).
 10. *How to save the data*: at the bottom right there is a =FORMAT= and
     =DOWNLOAD= button. You can download the subset of data you are
     playing with as "comma separated value" =csv= file (see drop down
     menu for other options). This format can then be open and analyzed
     using spread sheets without any coding.
 11. Try to search online for galactic structures (e.g., arms) or
     clusters and see if you can find them in the data!
